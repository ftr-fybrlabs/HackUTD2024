# HackUTD 2024
Our customers enjoy our blazing-fast, reliable internet but from time to time have issues that can be fixed easily or would likely benefit from other value-added services we provide. We’re looking for ways to intelligently recommend products to our customers

## The Challenge
Your challenge is to develop an app that helps recommend products the customer could benefit from.  Want to take it to the next level?  Include an augmented reality or Generative AI (GenAI) component!​<br><br>
We will provide data and a data dictionary to gain insights on customer behavior such as number of devices, bandwidth utilization and power drops as well as Frontier’s product catalog to create product recommendations.​<br><br>

### Data
For the challenge, you'll be provided three things:
1. Data about our existing customers, their home networks, and some of the products they've purchased in the past.
2. Some example data from customers who may (or may not) benefit from upgrades or additional products.
3. A "product catalog" that gives you some information about other products they can purchase and some of the benefits and requirements.

You can find this data [here](./data)
